\section{Verification}
In this section we present tests performed in order to verify our implementation.

\subsection{Degeneracy Tests}
In the degeneracy tests we verify the behaviour of our simulator with parameters set to 0 value. In all tests the simulator works properly. In particular the following observations can be inferred:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the number of channel is 0 then the simulation stops immediately because has no sense running a simulation with 0 channels
	\item If the time slot size is 0 then the simulation doesn't stop and goes to infinite because on instant 0  time slots are continuously triggered.
	\item If the exponential mean is 0 then the simulation doesn't stop and continues to infinite because packets arrive at time 0 continuously.
\end{itemize}
