\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Modules}
The following modules has been defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Transmitter}: duty of sending a packet to a specific channel. Parameters: $K$, $lambda$, $p$, overflow Signal (for the queue)
	\item \textbf{Channel}: duty of checking every channel in each timeslot for any collision. Parameters: $T_timeslot$, Throughput Signal
	\item \textbf{Receiver}: duty of receiving a packet from the channel. Parameters: $T_{threshold}$, Response Time Signal, Threshold Signal
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Messages}
A new format of message has been defined with the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{simtime-t creationTime}: time in which the packet arrives for the first time at the Transmitter
	\item \textit{int idChannel}: Channel choosed for the current transmission, may change in case of collision
	\item \textit{int idTransmitter} ??
	\item \textit{int indexTx} ??
	\item \textit{int idReceiver} ??
\end{itemize}
