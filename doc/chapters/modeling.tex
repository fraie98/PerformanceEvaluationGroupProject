\section{Modeling}
\subsection{Introduction}

\subsection{General Assumptions}
The following general assumption has been made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Pure Slotted}: packets are attempted to be transmitter by the Transmitter only at the \textbf{beginning of the timeslot}
	\item \textbf{Constant Packet Size and Transmission Rate}: each packet has a constant packet size and each transmitter has a constant and equal transmission rate for which to transmit a packet (without collision) from the receiver to the transmitter will last \textbf{one timeslot}.
	\item \textbf{No Propagation Error in the channel}: the only cause of a failed transmission has to be considered as the packet collision. Other causes, i.e. path-loss, are 
	\item \textbf{FIFO Queues of limited Capacity at the Transmitter} 
	\item \textbf{Transmitters and Receivers always synchronized with the timeslot period}
	\item \textbf{After an eventual collision the packet will change his channel choice}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Factors}
The following factors has been defined which may affect the performance of the system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{N}: Transmitter-Receiver Couples.
	\item \textbf{C}: numbers of Channels.
	\item \textbf{p}: probability of success for sending a packet in the current timeslot for a Transmitter.
	\item \textbf{$lambda$}: exponential distribution rate of packets arrival at the Transmitter.
	\item \textbf{K}: Transmitter Buffer Size.
	\item $T_{deadline}$: deadline in case of communication with a real-time system.
	\item $T_{timeslot}$: timeslot duration. 
\end{itemize}
